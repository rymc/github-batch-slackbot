# GitHub Issue & PR Summaries and Feedback: AI-Powered Slack Updates

This Slack bot helps engineering teams stay on top of their GitHub issues and pull requests by automatically providing periodic AI-powered summaries and feedback directly in Slack. Perfect for:

- Software engineers staying informed about bug reports and feature requests
- Engineering managers tracking activity across multiple repositories
- Product managers needing quick issue overviews
- Team leads who want to reduce time spent in issue triage
- Open source maintainers managing high-volume repositories

## Quick Start (2-Minute Setup)

1. Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  github-summary-bot:
    image: public.ecr.aws/o6q8k5w4/llm/github-summary-slackbot:latest
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - GITHUB_ORG=a-github-org     # A GitHub organization name
      - SLACK_CHANNEL=your-channel  # Channel to post summaries
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 9 * * *  # Daily at 9 AM
      - RUN_NOW=true            # Run immediately when container starts
      - LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1   
      - LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your tokens (see [Getting Required Tokens](#getting-required-tokens) below):

```bash
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
GH_TOKEN=your_github_token
SLACK_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
```

3. Start the bot:
```bash
docker compose up -d
or
docker-compose up -d # for older dockers
```

That's it! The bot has built in scheduling will now post periodic summaries to your Slack channel.

## How It Works

1. The bot periodically checks your GitHub repositories for new issues and pull requests
2. It uses an LLM's Batch API (powered by Meta Llama 3.1 405B) to create summaries and provide feedback
3. Summaries and feedback are automatically posted to your Slack channels

## Why Batch Processing?

Instead of processing issues one at a time, this bot handles them in batches, which means:

- 🚀 **Efficient Processing**: Rather than making individual API calls for each issue, the batch API allows simultaneous processing of multiple issues in one request
- 💰 **Lower Costs**: Batch processing offers better prices and scalability compared to individual API calls
- 🛡️ **Better Rate Limits**: Real-time APIs often have strict limits on requests/tokens per minute/hour - batch processing helps stay within these constraints
- 🤖 **Automated Workflows**: Set it and forget it - the bot automatically collects new issues since its last run and processes them in batches

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run this bot is using Docker Compose and our prebuilt image [shown here](#quick-start-2-minute-setup).

1. Clone this repository and cd into it.

2. Create a `.env` file with your API keys (see [Getting Required Tokens](#getting-required-tokens) below):
```bash
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
GH_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
SLACK_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
```

3. Configure your settings in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  llm-github-summary-bot:
    build: .
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 9 * * *  # Run daily at 9 AM
      - RUN_NOW=true            # Run immediately when container starts
      - GITHUB_ORG=your-org     # Your GitHub organization
      - GITHUB_REPO=your-repo   # Optional: specific repo (remove for org-wide)
      - SLACK_CHANNEL=your-channel
      - LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1   
      - LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1
      # Optional: adjust these as needed
      - BATCH_CLEANUP=true # delete local generated files
      - KEEP_DAYS=7 # days to keep local files
      - DEBUG=false 
```

4. Start the bot:
```bash
docker compose up -d
or 
docker-compose up -d # for older dockers
```

The bot will run according to the schedule you set in `CRON_SCHEDULE`. You can view logs with:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
or 
docker-compose logs -f # for older dockers
```

### Getting Required Tokens

#### LLM API Key
1. Sign up at your LLM provider
3. Go to the API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the API key and store it in the .env file

### Scheduling Options

This bot offers flexible scheduling options to fit your team's workflow:

#### 1. Using Docker Compose 
The built-in scheduler uses cron syntax, making it easy to set up regular runs:

```yaml
environment:
  - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 9 * * *  # Daily at 9 AM
  - RUN_NOW=true            # Also run when container starts
```

Common scheduling patterns:
- `0 9 * * *` - Every day at 9 AM
- `0 9 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 9 AM
- `0 8 * * MON` - Weekly on Monday mornings


#### 2. Manual Runs
You can also trigger the bot manually:

```bash
# Run once
docker compose run --rm llm-github-summary-bot

# Or with direct Docker command
docker run --env-file .env llm-github-summary-bot
```
## Running Multiple Instances

You can run multiple instances of the bot with different configurations by modifying your `docker-compose.yml`. Here's how:

```yaml
services:
  github-summary-bot-team1:
    build: .
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 9 * * *  # Run daily at 9 AM
      - RUN_NOW=true
      - GITHUB_ORG=team1-org
      - GITHUB_REPO=team1-repo
      - SLACK_CHANNEL=team1-updates
      - BATCH_CLEANUP=true
      
  github-summary-bot-team2:
    build: .
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 14 * * *  # Run daily at 2 PM
      - RUN_NOW=true
      - GITHUB_ORG=team2-org
      - SLACK_CHANNEL=team2-updates  # Different channel
      # Monitor all repos in org by omitting GITHUB_REPO
      
  github-summary-bot-opensource:
    build: .
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 10 * * 1  # Run Mondays at 10 AM
      - RUN_NOW=false
      - GITHUB_ORG=opensource-org
      - GITHUB_REPO=public-repo
      - SLACK_CHANNEL=opensource-updates
      - KEEP_DAYS=30  # Keep files longer
```

Each service can have its own:
- Schedule (`CRON_SCHEDULE`)
- GitHub organization and optional repository
- Slack channel
- Cleanup settings
- Other configuration options

To manage individual instances:

```bash
# Start all instances
docker compose up -d

# Start specific instance
docker compose up -d github-summary-bot-team1

# View logs for specific instance
docker compose logs -f github-summary-bot-team2

# Stop specific instance
docker compose stop github-summary-bot-opensource
```

## How It Works
This app summarises GitHub issues and pull requests in a few key steps:

### 1. Fetch Issues & Pull Requests
The script checks for new or updated GitHub issues since the last run. It can either monitor a single repository or all repositories in an organization.

```python
def fetch_github_issues(
    github_token: str,
    owner: str,
    repo: str | None,
    last_run_file: Path
) -> list:
    since = get_last_run_time(last_run_file)
    headers = {"Authorization": f"token {github_token}"}
    
    all_issues = []
    repos_to_check = [repo] if repo else fetch_org_repos(owner, headers)
    
    for repo in repos_to_check:
        github_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues"
        # Fetches issues and their comments, respecting token limits
        # Returns list of issues with their content
```

### 2. Process GitHub Post and Comments
Retrieve any comments from the GitHub issue and verify/preprocess so that they fit within the context window for each request.

```python
def process_issue_content(issue: dict, input_token_limit: int, headers: dict) -> dict:
    base_content = f"Repository: {issue['repository_name']}\nTitle: {issue['title']}\nBody: {issue['body']}"
    base_tokens = calculate_tokens(base_content)
    
    if base_tokens > input_token_limit:
        # Truncate if needed
        print(f"Issue {issue['number']} exceeds max input token per request limit. Truncating...")
    else:
        # Fetch comments if space allows
        remaining_tokens = input_token_limit - base_tokens
        if issue.get("comments", 0) > 0 and remaining_tokens > 0:
            issue['comments_text'] = fetch_issue_comments(...)
```

### 3. Prepare and Submit Batch Job
The processed issues are formatted into a batch job for the LLM API. Each issue becomes a request in the batch job, with prompting for summarization.

```python
def prepare_llm_job(
    model: str,
    requests: list,
    batch_dir: str = "batch_files"
) -> Tuple[list, Path]:
    tasks = []
    for request in requests:
        task = {
            "method": "POST",
            "url": "/v1/chat/completions",
            "body": {
                "model": model,
                "messages": [
                    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant..."},
                    {"role": "user", "content": f"Repository: {repo_name}\nTitle: {title}\nBody: {body}\nComments: {comments_text}"},
                ],
            },
            "metadata": {
                "issue_url": issue_url,
                "title": title,
                "repo_name": repo_name
            }
        }
        tasks.append(task)
```


### 4. Monitor and Process Results
Once the batch job completes, the script processes the results, organizing them by repository.

```python
def process_and_post_results(
    org_name: str,
    slack_channel: str,
    slack_token: str,
    file_dir: Path,
    debug: bool = False
) -> None:
    # Organize results by repository
    repo_results = {}
    for result in results:
        repo_name = result.get("repo_name", "unknown")
        if repo_name not in repo_results:
            repo_results[repo_name] = []
        
        repo_results[repo_name].append(
            f"*Title:* <{issue_url}|[{title}]>\n{summary}\n"
        )
```

### 5. Post to Slack
Finally, the organized summaries are posted to Slack, grouped by repository for better readability.

```python
def post_to_slack(channel: str, text: str, token: str):
    slack_url = "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"
    }
    
    # Split message into chunks if needed
    chunks = chunk_message(text)
    
    for chunk in chunks:
        data = {
            "channel": channel,
            "text": chunk,
            "unfurl_links": False,
            "unfurl_media": False
        }
```

The script also includes automatic cleanup of old batch files, controlled by these settings:
```yaml
processing:
  batch:
    cleanup: true  # Enable/disable cleanup
    keep_days: 7   # Number of days to keep files
    generated_files_directory: batch_files  # Directory to clean
```

## Organization-wide Summaries

This tool can monitor issues across all repositories in your GitHub organization. To enable this:

1. Remove the repo field in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
api:
  github:
    owner: "your-github-org"
    # repo field removed for org-wide monitoring
```

2. Ensure your GitHub token has appropriate permissions:
   - For public repositories: `public_repo` scope is sufficient
   - For private repositories: `repo` scope is required
   - The `read:org` scope is required to list organization repositories

When running in organization-wide mode, the tool will:
1. First fetch all accessible repositories in your organization
2. Then check for new issues in each repository since the last run
3. Group the summaries by repository when posting to Slack

This is particularly useful for:
- Organizations with many active repositories
- Teams that need to keep track of issue activity across multiple projects

## How Batch Processing Works

New to using Batch APIs? Think of it like sending a big batch of laundry to be cleaned, rather than washing one item at a time. Here's how it works:

1. **Create and Upload Your Request File**
First, you create a JSONL file (think: JSON, but one complete request per line). Here's what it looks like:

```json
{
    "custom_id": "issue-1",
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "/v1/chat/completions",
    "body": {
        "model": "gpt-4.1",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant that summarizes GitHub issues."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Repository: example-repo. Title: Issue rendering notebooks on small screens. Body:Tested on a bunch of phones and tablets.1. Comments: Happens for me too on...."
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The actual JSONL file will contain multiple requests, one per line. For example:
```json
{"custom_id": "issue-1", "method": "POST", ...}
{"custom_id": "issue-2", "method": "POST", ...}
{"custom_id": "issue-3", "method": "POST", ...}
```

Then upload and submit it:
```python
def submit_llm_job(client: OpenAI, last_run_file: Path, file_dir: Path) -> str:
    # Upload your JSONL file of requests
    batch_input_file = client.files.create(
        file=open(input_path, "rb"),
        purpose="batch"    # Tell the LLM API this is for batch processing
    )
    
    # Start the batch job - it will process all requests in your file
    response = client.batches.create(
        input_file_id=batch_input_file.id,
        endpoint="/v1/chat/completions",
        completion_window="24h",    # Job will complete within 24 hours
    )
    return response.id
```

2. **Watch Your Job's Progress**
Like tracking a delivery, you can monitor how many requests have been processed:
```python
def monitor_batch_status(client, batch_id: str, interval: int = 10) -> dict:
    while True:
        batch_status = client.batches.retrieve(batch_id)
        # Shows progress like: "Completed requests: 45 / 100"
        print(f"Completed requests: {batch_status.request_counts.completed} / {batch_status.request_counts.total}")

        # Check if job is done (or had problems)
        if batch_status.status.lower() in ["completed", "failed", "canceled"]:
            break
        time.sleep(interval)    # Wait 10 seconds before checking again
    return batch_status
```

3. **Get Your Results**
When complete, you'll get back a JSONL file with all your results:
```python
def retrieve_result_file_contents(batch_status, client, file_dir: Path) -> Path:
    # Download your results file
    result_file_id = batch_status.output_file_id
    results = client.files.content(result_file_id).content
    
    # Save to your computer
    result_path = file_dir / "batch_results.jsonl"
    with open(result_path, "wb") as file:
        file.write(results)
```

The results file will look something like this:
```json
{"id": "1a3157a8", "custom_id": "issue-1", "response": {"status_code": 200, "body": {"choices": [{"message": {"content": "*TL;DR Summary*: Crashing becoming more common..."}}]}}}
{"id": "2b4268b9", "custom_id": "issue-2", "response": {"status_code": 200, "body": {"choices": [{"message": {"content": "*TL;DR Summary*: Users having issues logging in recently..."}}]}}}
....
```
